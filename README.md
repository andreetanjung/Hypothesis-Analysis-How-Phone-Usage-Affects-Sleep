# Hypothesis-Analysis-How-Phone-Usage-Affects-Sleep
### Would Increased Phone Usage Significantly Affect an Individual's Sleep Cycle
#### Project Overview
In this notebook, we will explore the implementation of a one-sided two-tail hypothesis based on the findings of our exploratory data analysis. The objective of this notebook is to provide evidence supporting the acceptance of our hypothesis theory.
#### Data
The dataset is obtained on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika1011/sleepqual-and-bhealth-dataset. The dataset is about sleep quality and behavioral health of 24 university students collected using their smartwatches and smartphones for 7 consecutive days and nights.

As we can observe, the p-value falls outside the confidence interval area, indicating a significant impact of phone usage on the sleep cycle.
