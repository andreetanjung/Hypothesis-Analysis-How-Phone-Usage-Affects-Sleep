# Hypothesis-Analysis-How-Phone-Usage-Affects-Sleep
### Project Overview
In this notebook, we will explore the implementation of a one-sided two-tail hypothesis based on the findings of our exploratory data analysis. The objective of this notebook is to provide evidence supporting the acceptance of our hypothesis theory: 'Would Increased Phone Usage Significantly Affect an Individual's Sleep Cycle'
### Data
The dataset is obtained on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika1011/sleepqual-and-bhealth-dataset. The dataset is about sleep quality and behavioral health of 24 university students collected using their smartwatches and smartphones for 7 consecutive days and nights.

  -  Problem statement
  -  Background information
  -  Elaboration questions
- [ ] Data Loading and Overview
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Question answering
### Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis by answering several problems
    - How many calories and hours of screen time do individuals have in a week?
    - How many individuals are classified as "active"?
    - What is the correlation between the total sleep time and screen time of active people?
    - How does the total sleep time vary by category? 
2. Hypothesis Testing: in here we use two sample one tail test for the hypothesis
### Result and Evaluation
![pvalue](https://github.com/andreetanjung/Hypothesis-Analysis-How-Phone-Usage-Affects-Sleep/assets/123824152/e3bfd3f1-9aa3-4d65-9822-91276e5926b5)
<sub> P-value visualization <sub>

As we can observe, the p-value falls outside the confidence interval area, indicating a significant impact of phone usage on the sleep cycle.
